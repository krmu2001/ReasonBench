Required Words: grass, value, jail

The mountain sighs beneath the winter snow
The river carves its path with solemn might
The flowers sleep beneath the frozen glow
Awaiting touch of spring’s returning light

No jail confines the wild and restless breeze
It tumbles past the valley’s sleeping door
The grass will rise when winter grants release
Yet value fades along the rocky shore

The colors blend beneath a paling sky
The stars retreat behind a drifting veil
Though grass returns, some dreams must say goodbye
And hearts once brave grow weary and grow pale

The seasons turn, and leave us wondering still
What value clings to hope, and what to will.

Upon the cliffs the storm begins to roar
The candles flicker in the empty hall
The silver mist creeps underneath the door
A solemn hush descends upon the wall

No grassy fields are near this barren land
No value glimmers in the heavy rain
No jail can hold the fury in its hand
The waves collapse against the rocks in vain

The sailors cry into the endless dark
No flame to guide them through the cruel, wild gale
No harvest waits beyond the fading spark
Just shattered hopes imprisoned without bail

Their names are lost beneath the mourning wave
No grass, no value, only storms to brave.

'''Upon the hill where once the grass was green
The winds now whisper secrets of the vale,
A place where none but memories have been
And sorrow weeps behind a broken jail.

The stars above reflect in pools below
While tender dreams dissolve without a trace,
Yet hope still carves its message in the snow
And leaves the value written on its face.

The seasons turn with neither grief nor song
And grass will rise to meet the morning tide,
The heart must travel even when it's wrong,
And seek the dreams that time cannot deride.

We hold the broken past within our hands,
And plant new hopes upon the barren lands.

---END-OF-SONNET---

In fields of gold where bending grasses sway
I found a road that led beyond the stream,
A shining path that twisted night to day,
And led me farther from the jail of dream.

The value of a single step was small
Yet each one built a bridge of lasting stone;
The stars above seemed waiting for the call
To guide me far from everything I'd known.

The blades of grass were wet with morning's grace
And songs of sparrows filled the misty air;
They sang of freedom no jail could replace
Of journeys shaped by hope beyond despair.

I walked the road and felt the future start,
The grass and stars still singing in my heart.

---END-OF-SONNET---

The jail was hidden deep beneath the trees (A)
Where no soft grass could ever hope to grow. (B)
The shadows whispered warnings on the breeze, (A)
A chilling song the heart would never know. (B)

No value marked the time that passed away, (C)
The walls were cold and silent in their might, (D)
And grassless stones forever bleak and gray (C)
Reflected only sorrow in their sight. (D)

Yet through the cracks a single flower rose (E)
Defiant in the darkness and the pain, (F)
Its fragile beauty trembling as it grows, (E)
A symbol that the spirit will remain. (F)

Where grass may fail, and even value die, (G)
Still hope will blossom if it dares to try. (G)

# React prompt for SonnetWriting
react = '''You are fluent in sonnet writing. You will be given a task that specifies the rhyme scheme and words that must be included. Your task is to write a sonnet that follows these requirements while maintaining poetic quality.

You should think step by step about the logical reasoning needed to write the sonnet:

1. First, analyze the rhyme scheme and required words
2. Then, plan how to incorporate the required words naturally
3. Next, develop a theme that connects these words meaningfully
4. Finally, write the sonnet following the required format

(Example)
Task: Write a sonnet with rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG and include the words: grass, value, jail

Thought: Let me analyze the requirements step by step:
1. Need to follow ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyme scheme
2. Must include "grass", "value", and "jail" naturally
3. Should create a theme connecting these words
4. Need to write in iambic pentameter

Thought: Let me plan the sonnet structure:
1. First quatrain: Introduce "grass" and set the scene
2. Second quatrain: Incorporate "jail" and develop theme
3. Third quatrain: Use "value" and reinforce theme
4. Couplet: Conclude with a meaningful message

Thought: Now I'll write the sonnet following this plan:

The river bends beside the morning grass (A)
A shimmer dances on the silver tide (B)
The hours like golden moments swiftly pass (A)
And fortune's value flows with gentle pride (B)

The jail of fear breaks open with the breeze (C)
The open fields forgive the bitter rain (D)
The grass revives beneath the waking trees (C)
And songs of hope replace the cries of pain (D)

The jail of winter thaws beneath the light (F)
The value found in spring will never die (E)
But bloom in endless fields beyond our sight (F)

The grass will grow where broken dreams once fall (G)
And value shines within the hearts of all. (G)
