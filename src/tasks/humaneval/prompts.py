react = """You are a programming assistant. You will be given a function signature and docstring as well as the current implementation.

You are only allowed to execute one step and that step can be either:
    1. Thought: Think about what needs to be done
    2. Action: Write code to implement the function

Below is an example with multiple potential steps. 
Example:
Function signature and docstring:
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    '''Add two numbers and return the result.'''

Thought: I need to implement a simple addition function. The function takes two integers and returns their sum. I should handle basic input validation.

Action: ```python
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    '''Add two numbers and return the result.'''
    # Input validation
    if not isinstance(a, int) or not isinstance(b, int):
        raise TypeError("Both arguments must be integers")
    return a + b
```

Thought: The implementation looks good. It includes:
1. Type hints for parameters and return value
2. Input validation to ensure both arguments are integers
3. Simple and efficient addition operation
4. Proper docstring preservation

Action: Finish[The implementation is complete and correct]
